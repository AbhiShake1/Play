# 🎮 Play: Because Life's Too Short for Boring Games

Welcome to Play, where we're bringing back classic browser games with more stability than the JavaScript framework ecosystem. No corporate buzzwords here - just pure, unadulterated gaming fun that'll outlast the next trending frontend framework!

## 🚀 What's This All About?

Remember when you could play games without installing 50GB of "HD textures"? We're bringing that back, but with modern tech. In the time you read this sentence, 42 new JS frameworks were released - but don't worry, we picked the good ones that'll still be here tomorrow!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (aka What's Under The Hood)

- **SolidJS**: Because we're more stable than your package-lock.json
- **TanStack Router**: For routing that won't be deprecated next week
- **Kobalte**: Accessibility that's more consistent than framework release cycles
- **Tailwind CSS**: Because we needed at least one tool that everyone agrees on

## 🎯 Control Schemes (Pick Your Poison)

- **Arrow Keys**: For when you're pretending to work in Excel
- **Vim-style (hjkl)**: Because real developers never leave home row
- **Touch Controls**: For when your mechanical keyboard is in the shop
- **Gyroscope**: For when you want to feel as dizzy as keeping up with JS frameworks

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install    # Dependencies go brrr
pnpm start      # localhost:3000 || die
pnpm build      # Compile like it's 1999
pnpm serve      # Share with the world
```

## 🧪 Testing (Because We're Professionals™)

```bash
pnpm test       # Assert.true(this.works)
```

## 🎨 Code Style (The Holy Commandments)

We use Biome because tabs vs spaces is so 2010:

```bash
pnpm format     # Make it pretty
pnpm lint       # Fix || die
pnpm check      # Trust but verify
```
